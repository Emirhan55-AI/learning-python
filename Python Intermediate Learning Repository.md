This repository contains all the examples and exercises I completed during the Python Programming Language (Intermediate Level) course at BTK Academy. Throughout the program I progressed from the basics of Python to topics such as strings, lists, operators, conditional statements, loops, functions, modules, error handling and file operations. I have also included the Python Programming Language Intermediate Certificate awarded at the end of the course.

Course Content and What I Learned

Introduction to Python: Using the print() command to display output, declaring variables, basic data types (numbers, strings), receiving input from the user and type conversions.

Strings: Working with the string data type, indexing and slicing, built‑in methods (upper, lower, replace, split etc.), formatting strings and various string operations.

Lists: Creating lists, indexing and slicing, list operations (adding, deleting, updating), built‑in list methods (append, remove, insert, sort, reverse), working with nested lists.

Operators: Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **), comparison operators (==, !=, >, <), logical operators (and, or, not), membership and identity operators (in, is).

Conditional Statements: Evaluating conditions with if, elif, else blocks, using comparison and logical operators in conditions, nested conditionals.

Loops: Performing repeated operations with for and while loops, iterating over ranges (range) and iterable data structures, loop control statements (break, continue), nested loops.

Functions: Defining our own functions (def), parameters, default and keyword arguments, return values (return), function scope.

Modules: Using built‑in modules such as math and random, syntax of import and from ... import ..., creating and using our own module files.

Error Handling and File Operations: Catching and handling errors with try, except, else, finally blocks, raising custom errors (raise), opening and closing files, reading and writing modes, processing file contents line by line.
